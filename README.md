**I would like to share my results (94.15% accuracy on average) on the fashion-MNIST dataset. You can find further informations about the dataset on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).** 

## Dataset
- Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.

- Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

- Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

- It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
